id: CVE-2023-5203

info:
  name: WP Sessions Time Monitoring Full Automatic <= 1.0.8 - SQL Injection
  author: Shivam Kamboj
  severity: critical
  description: |
    The WP Sessions Time Monitoring Full Automatic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via request parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
  impact: |
    Attackers can retrieve sensitive database information without authentication, leading to data breach and privacy violations.
  remediation: |
    Update to version 1.0.9 or later to fix the vulnerability.
